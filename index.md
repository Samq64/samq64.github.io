## About me

I'm a 15 year old boy who started Scratching when I was 13. Since then I've learned Python and front-end web development, made a GitHub account and controbuted to a Scratch browser extension, participated in the Windows 11 beta program, played with virtual machines, dualbooted Linux, decided to ditch Windows altogether and now I'm learning Java.
