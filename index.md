## About me

I'm a 16 year old boy who started using [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) at 13. Since then I've learned Python, front-end web development and some basics of other languages. I contributed to the [Scratch Addons](https://scratchaddons.com) browser extension and eventually became a member of the GitHub organisation. I also ran Windows 11 beta my laptop, played with virtual machines, got a Raspberry Pi, dualbooted Linux, and ditched Windows a few weeks later. Now I'm a Linux fanboy running Fedora and planning on switching to Arch Linux.
